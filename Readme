## Important Notes
- **Please note**: HDO Box Plus is completely different from HDO Pro and is not connected to it in any way.
- **Note**: While the official HDO Box does not support or condone what we do, itâ€™s worth mentioning that HDO Box itself operates as a piracy app, thus already breaking some rules. Additionally, HDO PRO is a distinct project that prioritizes privacy and enhanced usability.
